								CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
								physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
								appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
								equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
							</p>
							<p>
								He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some
								exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang.
								Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
								begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
								evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
								that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
								faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
								instant.
							</p>
							<p>
								If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
								the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a
								jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all
								the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not
								missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
								ocean.
							</p>
							<p>
								“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
								page and drew a double box around it.
							</p>
							<p>
								On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
								reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
								that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
								right.
							</p>
							<p>
								Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
								cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
								astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian
								Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of
								space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a
								universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a
								trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They
								are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof,
								Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
							</p>
							<img src="" alt="" />
							<p>
								Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years,
								though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever
								be proved.
							</p>
							<p>
								If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
								science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
								pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would
								open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and
								speculation.
							</p>
							<p>
								Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
								extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
								billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
								cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
								Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless
								number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a
								pot of pasta water boiling over.
							</p>
							<h3>‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>
							<p>
								In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
								operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
								accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity
								itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
								observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
								Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
								space-time.
							</p>
							<p>
								Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
								expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big
								as it gets.”
							</p>
							<p>
								He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
								sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
							</p>
							<p>
								The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
								bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
								picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
								as the surface of the sun.
